[Strope+10 arXiv](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....140...34S/abstract)

Downloaded data from [VizieR](https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/AJ/140/34) (all 3 tables) as `| -Seperated-Values` stored in [Strope10_data](/Strope10_data).

Use:
- [table1_nolc.tsv](Strope10_data/table1_nolc.tsv) (lc is in table 2)
- [table2.tsv](Strope10_data\table2.tsv) (2 tables in this file look exactly the same... lightcurve table seems to be duplicated, not sure why. Table 1 is in the middle of the file (probably why lc is duplicated). Table 3 is included at the end of the file.)
- [table3_noSimbad.tsv](Strope10_data/table3_noSimbad.tsv) (with Simbad gives all data in tables 1 and 2)
