# check whether 'Small classes' are similar to 'Large classes' in the feature space

calculate distance between subsets:
    - for each subset, calc means of all features
    - for each feature, subtract means of subsets then add in quadrature
calculate spread for each subset
    - ...
    - compare this to the distance btwn subsets

maybe do this for each class, not each subset
