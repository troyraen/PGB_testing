software design paper +

Paper outline:
	- intro, historical context, review of current status of field
	- motivation: specific unmet needs (either just haven't been done before or haven't been needed before)
	- software design of broker
	- status of prototype
	- next step beyond prototype (deployed beta)
	- analysis of data. classifications, comparisons to others
	- example, if you wanted to do a rate analysis. or if have run classifier for a year and during that time had 3 different version, how to put output from those versions on equal footing to compare. Must track provinence sufficient to reconstruct selection function (~all brokers are talking about this, no one has successfully done this yet).


des SNe simulation selection function (transfer function). model for sensitivity, figure out efficiency, (e.g., sample selection effect as function of host galaxy background). have some process by which we detect objects; want to invert this process to make statements about the population.
